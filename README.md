This is a screenshot of the final step I completed! 

<h2>Description</h2>
This lab was pretty simple in that I first did the somewhat blue team part of detecting things through an IDS and Firewall. First, I detected intrusions using Snort. I also detected suspicious network traffic using ZoneAlarm. Then, I used HoneyBOT to detect malicious traffic. Switching over to the red team side, I then used evasion nmap techniques to bypass the windows firewall. Using HTTP tuneeling I then also bypassed a firewall. I then bypassed antivirus tools using Metasploit templates. Then lastly we bypassed yet another firewall using Windows BITSAdmin
