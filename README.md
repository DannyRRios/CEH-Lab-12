This is a screenshot of the final step I completed! 

<h2>Description</h2>
This lab was pretty simple in that we first did the somewhat blue team part of detecting things through an IDS and Firewall. First we detected intrusions using Snort. Then we detected suspicious network traffic using ZoneAlarm. Then we used HoneyBOT to detect malicious traffic. We then switched to the red team side and used evasion nmap techniques to bypass the windows firewall. We then bypassed a firewall using HTTP tunneling. We then bypassed antivirus using Metasploit templates. Then lastly we bypassed a firewall using Windows BITSAdmin
